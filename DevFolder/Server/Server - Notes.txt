Login (/edushare/api/v1.0/<username>/<password>) - if successful (user exists and correct credentials used) returns a JSON with user credentials (id, name, email and password). If unsuccessful, it returns a json with error: not found.

Sign-Up (/edushare/api/v1.0/register/<username>/<password>/<email>) - if successful (no security integrity protocols yet implemented for this procedure) returns a JSON with user credentials (id, name, email and password). If unsuccessful, it returns a json with error: not found.

Local Search (/edushare/api/v1.0/search/<search term>) - returns a JSON containing files (items) with tags that match search term. If there are no matching files, it returns JSON error not found.

API Search (/edushare/api/v1.0/apisearch/<search>) - returns a JSON the first page with a collection of matching items from Google Scholar, Mayan-EDMs, Open KM and Wikipedia (so far).
